Project Overview
This project implements an Autocompletion System from scratch using the n-grams model. 
The system is designed to predict the next word or phrase based on user input by analyzing the probability of word sequences.
Built entirely from the ground up, this project demonstrates the practical application of statistical language models to enhance text input efficiency and user experience.


Key Features
N-Grams Language Model: Custom-built n-grams model to predict the next word in a sequence based on prior context.

Real-Time Autocompletion: Provides instant word suggestions as the user types, improving typing efficiency.

Text Preprocessing: Comprehensive pipeline for tokenization, removing punctuation, and preparing the dataset for the n-grams model.

Scalable and Extensible: The system is designed to handle large datasets and can be extended for more complex language models in the future.


Technologies Used
Python: Core language for building the model and system.

NLTK: Used for text preprocessing, tokenization, and constructing the n-grams model.

NumPy & Pandas: Utilized for efficient data manipulation and processing.


How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The text data is cleaned, tokenized, and converted into n-grams sequences to capture context.

N-Grams Model: Built a statistical language model that predicts the next word by analyzing n-grams (sequence of n words).

Autocompletion: As users type, the model suggests the most probable word based on the context of the preceding words.
